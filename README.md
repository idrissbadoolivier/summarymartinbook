### Chapter Summaries from *Clean Code* by Robert C. Martin

#### Chapter 2: Meaningful Names  
**Summary:**  
Focuses on using **clear, self-explanatory names** for variables, functions, and classes. Key principles include:  
- Reveal intent and context  
- Avoid ambiguous abbreviations  
- Use pronounceable terms  
- Maintain consistent naming patterns  
- Eliminate "noise words" (e.g., `data`, `info`)  

**Key Takeaway:**  
> **Proper naming makes code self-documenting**, reducing reliance on comments.

#### Chapter 3: Functions  
**Summary:**  
Advocates for writing **small, single-purpose functions** that:  
- Do one thing well  
- Have limited parameters (≤3 ideal)  
- Avoid side effects  
- Follow command-query separation  
- Use descriptive action-based names  

**Key Takeaway:**  
> **Refactor complex logic into smaller functions** for modular, testable code.

#### Chapter 4: Comments  
**Summary:**  
Treats comments as a **last resort** when code can't express intent. Effective comments:  
- Explain *why* (never *what*)  
- Warn of consequences  
- Clarify complex algorithms  
- Document APIs  
Avoid redundant or misleading comments.  

**Key Takeaway:**  
> **Write expressive code first**, use comments only for non-obvious context.

#### Chapter 6: Objects and Data Structures  
**Summary:**  
Explores the tension between:  
- **Objects**: Hide data, expose behavior  
- **Data Structures**: Expose data, no behavior  
Key guidelines:  
- Avoid hybrids  
- Prefer immutability  
- Follow Law of Demeter  
- Choose based on context  

**Key Takeaway:**  
> **Objects encapsulate, data structures expose** – design consciously to reduce coupling.

### Why These Principles Matter  
These foundations enable **maintainable software**:  
1. **Meaningful Names** → Reduce cognitive load  
2. **Small Functions** → Enable reuse/testing  
3. **Minimal Comments** → Highlight exceptional cases  
4. **Clear Structures** → Define component boundaries  

> *"Clean code is simple, direct, and reads like well-written prose."*
